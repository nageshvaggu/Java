# Java
Java is an object-oriented programming language that produces software for multiple platforms. When a programmer writes a Java application, the compiled code (known as bytecode) runs on most operating systems (OS), including Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Java derives much of its syntax from the C and C++ programming languag
Java was developed in the mid-1990s by James A. Gosling, a former computer scientist with Sun Microsystems, together with Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton.
